# Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions Using Machine Learning

This project tackles a **classification problem**, predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on features from the **Bank Marketing dataset**, sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank%2Bmarketing).

The dataset includes detailed marketing campaign data such as:
- Client demographics
- Contact details
- Campaign outcomes

## Models Implemented
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Neural Network Classifier**

## Key Highlights
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering were applied for optimal model performance.
- Both models were evaluated based on:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

## Results
- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - Robust performance with high accuracy and interpretability.
  - Well-suited for structured data like the Bank Marketing dataset.
- **Neural Network Classifier**:
  - Strong predictive power and competitive performance.
  - Effective in capturing complex feature interactions.

## Conclusion
Both models proved effective in solving the classification problem, showcasing their suitability for financial prediction tasks. Detailed experimental results and model comparisons are included in the project report.
